======================================
Generating a Prefix List for your peer
======================================

Be sure to explain difference between aut-num and as-set.

Also, be sure to explain what these things are to someone from the ARIN region. Don't go deep, just explain a simple example record from RIPE or APNIC. Then work it through into how an inverse lookup works to find the prefixes.

HOWEVER, don't bore them, somewhere near the top show how to use bgpq3.
